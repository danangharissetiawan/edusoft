Boilerplate apps
================

### What is this?
Django boilerplate apps are a collection of apps that can be used to quickly.
get started with a new Django project. They are designed to be used as a base for a new project.
They are not designed to be used as a standalone app.

### Why?
I have found that I often start a new project with the same basic setup. I have a base project that I use as a starting point. I then copy the apps I need from that project into the new project. This is a pain and I wanted to make it easier.

### Setup instructions
1. Clone the repo
    ```shell
    git clone ...
   
   cd boilerplate
    ```
2. Run in Docker ([see below](#setup-django-boilerplate-with-docker))
3. Run in Local ([see below](#setup-django-boilerplate-with-local))
4. Npm install
    ```shell
    npm install
    ```
5. Run npm build
    ```shell
    npm run build
    ```
